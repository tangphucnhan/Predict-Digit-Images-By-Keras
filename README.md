# Predict digit images with Keras

This project build a Sequential model to predict digit images. Images are pre-processed by opencv to convert to proper image type before prediction.

## Getting started

```
cd scripts
```

- Create model, train and run it:
```
python ocr_keras.py 1
```

- Run with saved model
```
python ocr_keras.py
```
